Extensions
==========

Our application has the capability to be extended in many different ways. One way our application could 
be extended is to change the method we use to save searches made on our site to make it more dynamic. 
That is to say instead of reloading the current page after a search is made, the result of a search could
be sent asynchronously in the background to our web server. Also the functionality of both our search and
stream pages could be melded into one page. This way the results of a users search may be added to the 
current stream of music videos without interrupting viewing of current content.

In addition, seeing as our web application is to a degree the beginning of YouTube, many of the features
YouTube incorporates could easily be added on to our application. For example, having users sign up would
be a feature ideally we would have liked to implemented. This would have allowed us to do other cool 
extensions: storing streaming history for each individual user, allowing them to create playlists of music
videos to watch in the future, allowing them to create and view user comments, displaying related videos
to the one currently playing. Although none of these extensions are implemented, the easiest to incorporate
would be displaying related videos to the one already playing. This is because our videos are streamed in
modal windows, thus it would be very easy to use the YouTube API to search for related videos to the one 
being watched and display them off to the side in our modal window. These are just some of the ways you 
could extend our web applications.
