Our application has the capability to be extended in many different ways.
One way our application could be extended is to change the method we use to save the history 
of searches made on our site to make it more dynamic. That is to say instead of reloading the 
current page after a search is made, the results of the searches can be sent asynchronously in the background to our
web server. Also the functionalities of both search and stream pages in our application can be melded into one page.
This way the results of a users search may be added to the current stream of music videos without interrupting viewing 
of current content. Our application can also be extended to support both the creation and viewing of user comments relating to 
both the current stream and individually searched videos.
