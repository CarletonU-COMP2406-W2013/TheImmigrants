A few potential way that could extend our application:

- Display comments below the video. It could have been done by creating a few text fields below the embedded video, 
and let javascript fill in those text fields with most recent comments. 
Our existing code doesn't support this extension

- Display 3 related videos beside the embedded video. This could have been done by downloading screenshots off Youtube server, and just placing them into our page. Our existing code doesn't support this extension

Even though those extensions seem like cool features, we think that we built an ideal application that looks clean and easy to use. We believe we don't need those extra extensions.
