Motivation
==========

YouTube is one of the most well-known websites and video streaming supporters on the web today. Video streaming is
only getting bigger every day with companies like Netflix taking over the market. We thought it would be an awesome
opportunity to further our knowledge of JavaScript and related technologies if we created a music video streaming web 
application that implemented some of YouTube's features. This thought was supported by the fact that video streaming
requires creating an intuitive and well designed user interface along with writing a large amount of client side 
JavaScript for buffering and accessing the back-end store. Seeing as none of us had a clue about JavaScript at 
the beginning of the semester, we wanted to push the envelope and see what things we could actually implement ourselves.
One of us had already created a video streaming website, however it was done with flash and no JavaScript. This also 
motivated us to see how much better, cleaner and functional could an application be using JavaScript in conjunction 
with existing frameworks and API's. As well, we wanted a project that may actually have use to us in the future, after
completing our programs. As video streaming is so huge, we figured there is a good chance one of us might end up in
that field, therefore it was a good learning challenge that could give us specfic technical skills.

Our goals of the project were to have a page where users could search an artist and song title and have a corresponding
music video displayed below that they could stream. This was implemented along with other little details, such as an
autocomplete on both the artist and song text fields. As well, another feature added was making sure the data entered
was capitalized correctly before sending it to our server to be stored, so that later when the titles and artists are
displayed, they look uniform and professional. Our second goal was to have a webpage where users could view the top 6
played videos. This was also implemented successfully and when one of these music videos is selected, the linked video
is displayed in a modal window along with its information. And finally our third goal was to have a page where the top 
songs could be streamed continuously without user action required. This also was accomplished successfully.

Really, we wanted to challenge ourselves and learn about the problems with web development and on the other hand the
diverse and extremely cool frameworks and API's available to us. We truly succeeded. One member loved working with Twitter
Bootstrap and will definitely be using it in the future because of its simplicity and highly professional look. Another
group member made a complete about face on his opinion of JavaScript. He know realizes how powerful it is and just
cannot get enough of it. TWITTER BOOTSTRAP AND JAVASCRIPT ARE AWESOME!!
